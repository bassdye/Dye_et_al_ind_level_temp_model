The model framework is based on the individual level component of the consumer-resource model described by Persson et al. (1998) and the temperature dependent scaling formulation in Karås &amp; Thoresson (1992) and Ohlberger et al. (2011). 

## Model analysis
The Escalator Boxcar Train (EBT) program package developed by [André de Roos](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/a.m.deroos/index.html) was used to conduct the model simulations.
- The EBT package software for model analysis is available [here](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/a.m.deroos/EBT/Software/index.html). 
- EBT package software documentation is available [here](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/a.m.deroos/EBT/Documentation/index.html).

## Model files
- See the [model_specific_files folder](https://github.com/bassdye/Dye_et_al_ind_level_temp_model/tree/main/model_specific_files) for the model definition files.
- See the [species_specific_files folder](https://github.com/bassdye/Dye_et_al_ind_level_temp_model/tree/main/species_specific_files) for the species specific model input files (control variable files (.cvf) and initial state files (.isf)).
  - Files for decadel temperature regimes (1980s, 2010s) are located in separate folders.
  - Resource levels (1.0, 0.7, 0.5) are indicated in the file name (e.g. feed_1 is resource level 1).

A generic bioenergetics-based model for predicting how warming and resource levels impact the performance of fish in different guilds 

_Abstract_
>The ability to predict how fishes respond to changes in temperature and resource variability is paramount to developing sustainable management plans and for projecting the direct and indirect effects of climate change. We developed a versatile, physiological model capable of providing size-specific estimates of fish growth and fecundity across varying temperatures and resource levels. The model includes a mechanistic representation of individual-level life history processes across diverse biogeographic and functional fish guilds, using direct, species-specific parameter estimates. We provide examples of its application to five marine species (Atlantic cod, Atlantic herring, five-bearded rockling, European sprat, and thinlip mullet) which differ in life history strategies and biogeographic distributions, but that all rely on intertidal nursery habitats—areas particularly susceptible to anthropogenic change. In all simulations, resource availability had a stronger influence on fish performance than temperature. Nevertheless, the model also revealed how and why higher temperatures often decreased fitness and/or survival of specific types of species. We made no changes to the model structure for different species and the resulting model predictions were not fitted but based on the ecophysiological first-principles. Comparison between modelled and empirical data collected in the shallow Wadden Sea (southern North Sea) confirmed benefits of warming to thermophilic, range-expanding species, while core (established) species at their lower latitudinal limits of their distribution face local extirpation. The model allows insight into more variables than often reported from survey and monitoring efforts, such as reproductive output. Even small water temperature increases can cause physiological impacts on growth and energy partitioning that can severely affect fish performance and constrain elements of their life history. This physiological model is applicable to a wide range of species, geographic regions, and research objectives, making it valuable for generating knowledge needed to buttress actions aimed at addressing ecological and conservation challenges in a future climate.
