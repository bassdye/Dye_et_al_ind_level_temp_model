The model framework is based on the individual level component of the consumer-resource model described by Persson et al. (1998) and the temperature dependent scaling formulation in Karås &amp; Thoresson (1992) and Ohlberger et al. (2011). 

## Model analysis
The Escalator Boxcar Train (EBT) program package developed by [André de Roos](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/a.m.deroos/index.html) was used to conduct the model simulations.
- The EBT package software for model analysis is available [here](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/a.m.deroos/EBT/Software/index.html). 
- EBT package software documentation is available [here](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/a.m.deroos/EBT/Documentation/index.html).

## Model files
- See the [model_specific_files folder](https://github.com/bassdye/Dye_et_al_ind_level_temp_model/tree/main/model_specific_files) for the model definition files.
- See the [species_specific_files folder](https://github.com/bassdye/Dye_et_al_ind_level_temp_model/tree/main/species_specific_files) for the species specific model input files (control variable files (.cvf) and initial state files (.isf)).
  - Files for decadel temperature regimes (1980s, 2010s) are located in separate folders.
  - Resource levels (1.0, 0.7, 0.5) are indicated in the file name (e.g. feed_1 is resource level 1).

A novel bioenergetics-based model for predicting how warming and resource levels impact the performance of fish in different guilds 

_Abstract_
>The ability to predict how fishes respond to changes in temperature and resource variability is paramount to developing sustainable management plans and for projecting the direct and indirect effects of climate change. We present a versatile, bioenergetics model capable of providing size-specific estimates of fish growth and fecundity across varying temperatures and resource levels. This tool enables exploration of individual-level life history processes across diverse biogeographic and functional fish guilds. The model was tested and corroborated for five marine species (Atlantic cod, Atlantic herring, five-bearded rockling, European sprat, and thinlip mullet) that rely on intertidal nursery habitats—areas particularly susceptible to anthropogenic change. In all simulations, resource availability had a stronger influence on fish performance than temperature. Under identical resource levels, higher temperatures often negatively affected performance, revealing how and why warming caused decreases in fitness and/or survival. Applying the model to the Wadden Sea (southern North Sea) fish community suggested that opportunistic species may benefit from rising temperatures, while core (established) species at the lower latitudinal limits of their distribution may face local extirpation. Even small increases in water temperature can severely affect fish physiology and life history, potentially disrupting population dynamics and, hence, species interactions within ecosystems. This bioenergetics model provides a flexible tool applicable to a wide range of species, geographic regions, and research objectives, making it valuable for addressing ecological and conservation challenges in the face of climate change.
