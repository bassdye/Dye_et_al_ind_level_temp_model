# Dye_et_al_ind_level_temp_model
The model framework is based on the individual level component of the consumer-resource model described by Persson et al. (1998) and the temperature dependent scaling formulation in KarÃ¥s &amp; Thoresson (1992) and Ohlberger et al. (2011). 

## Model analysis
The Escalator Boxcar Train (EBT) program package developed by [Andre de Roos](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/a.m.deroos/index.html) was used to conduct the model simulations.
- The EBT package software to analyze the model is available [here](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/a.m.deroos/EBT/Software/index.html). 
- Documentation how to implement the EBT package is available [here](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/a.m.deroos/EBT/Documentation/index.html).

## Model files
- See the [model_specific_files folder](https://github.com/bassdye/Dye_et_al_ind_level_temp_model/tree/main/model_specific_files) for the model definition files.
- See the [species_specific_files folder](https://github.com/bassdye/Dye_et_al_ind_level_temp_model/tree/main/species_specific_files) for the species specific model input files (control variable files (.cvf) and initial state files (.isf)).

Disentangling the effects of resource level and temperature-dependence on the performance of fish species in different guild

_Abstract_
>Changes in environmental conditions due to climate change are globally evident. Coastal marine zones support highly diverse marine communities and understanding the response of species and their life stages to (a)biotic changes provides insight into the past, current, and future function of a coastal ecosystem. To better understand how environmental factors (water temperature and resource availability) influence individual level life history processes of fish, we developed a species-specific, temperature dependent, energy budget model. The individual energetics of five species representing contrasting fish guilds were studied and empirically validated using data from a shallow, intertidal sea known for its crucial fish nursery and habitat area. We found that responses to environmental conditions varied among species and are depending on individual size. Increased resource levels generally led to larger body sizes and greater reproductive output, but higher temperatures often resulted in reduced physiological performance, particularly for boreal (cool temperature-favoring) species. The results of this study suggest that some species will be disproportionately affected by increasing water temperature. On-going water temperature increases are predicted to position some species under suboptimal conditions for physiological processes. Conversely, warm temperature-favoring species are predicted to mostly benefit from rising water temperature, giving rise to a changing ecological role for this species in the ecosystem. Our findings suggest that even small increases in water temperature can have significant effects on the physiology and life history of fish species, which may ultimately impact their population dynamics and interactions with other species in the ecosystem.
