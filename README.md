# Dye_et_al_ind_level_temp_model
The model framework is based on the individual level component of the consumer-resource model described by Persson et al. (1998) and the temperature dependent scaling formulation in Kar√•s &amp; Thoresson (1992) and Ohlberger et al. (2011). 

## Model analysis
The Escalator Boxcar Train (EBT) program package developed by [Andre de Roos](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/a.m.deroos/index.html) was used to conduct the model simulations.
- The EBT package software to analyze the model is available [here](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/a.m.deroos/EBT/Software/index.html). 
- Documentation how to implement the EBT package is available [here](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/a.m.deroos/EBT/Documentation/index.html).

## Model files
- See the [model_specific_files folder](https://github.com/bassdye/Dye_et_al_ind_level_temp_model/tree/main/model_specific_files) for the model definition files.
- See the [species_specific_files folder](https://github.com/bassdye/Dye_et_al_ind_level_temp_model/tree/main/species_specific_files) for the species specific input files (control variable files (.cvf) and initial state files (.isf)).
